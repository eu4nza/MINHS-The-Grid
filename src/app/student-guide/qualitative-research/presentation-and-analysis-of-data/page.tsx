                    findings confirm existing literature on the challenges of
                    blended learning in public schools. For instance, studies
                    have highlighted the critical role of internet
                    infrastructure in the successful implementation of blended
                    learning. Our findings align with these, confirming that
                    unreliable internet is a significant barrier.

                    While much of the literature emphasizes training deficits,
                    our study found that teachers, despite lacking formal
                    training, have become quite resourceful and innovative in
                    adapting their teaching methods. This contradicts the
                    general narrative that teachers are unable to effectively
                    implement blended learning without proper training.

                    The study reveals significant gaps in institutional support,
                    particularly in rural areas. This highlights the need for
                    policy makers in Cavite to prioritize investments in
                    internet infrastructure and teacher training programs.
                    Addressing these issues could lead to more equitable and
                    effective blended learning outcomes across the region.
